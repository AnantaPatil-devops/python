**AWS VPC and Network Setup Automation**

This Python script utilizes the Boto3 library to automate the creation of an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and
  related network components. The script follows a structured process to create and configure various network resources, including a VPC,
subnets, internet gateways, route tables, and a NAT gateway. The automation is aimed at streamlining the setup process, reducing manual 
  intervention, and ensuring consistency in network configurations.

The script begins by establishing a connection to the AWS EC2 service using Boto3. It proceeds with the following steps:

1. **VPC Creation**: A new VPC is created with a specified CIDR block (IPv4 address range) and a meaningful name. The script associates 
    appropriate tags for better management and identification.

2. **Internet Gateway Creation**: An internet gateway (IGW) is generated to enable communication between the VPC and the internet.
    The IGW is tagged for identification.

3. **IGW Attachment**: The previously created IGW is attached to the VPC, establishing connectivity between the VPC and the internet.

4. **Public Subnet Creation**: A public subnet is created within the VPC, with a designated CIDR block. This subnet is designed to host 
  resources that require direct internet access.

5. **Private Subnet Creation**: A private subnet is generated within the VPC, using a distinct CIDR block. Resources placed in this 
  subnet can access the internet via a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway, which is created later.

6. **Custom Route Table Creation**: A custom route table is created for the VPC. This route table will be used to control traffic between 
  subnets and the internet.

7. **IGW Addition to Route Table**: The script adds a route to the custom route table, associating it with the IGW. This setup ensures
  that traffic destined for the internet can flow through the IGW.

8. **Subnet Association**: The public subnet is associated with the custom route table, enabling instances within the subnet to access 
  the internet via the IGW.

9. **Elastic IP Allocation**: An Elastic IP address is allocated for use by the NAT gateway, which enables resources in private subnets
  to initiate outbound connections to the internet.

10. **NAT Gateway Creation**: A NAT gateway is created using the allocated Elastic IP and associated with the private subnet. 
  This gateway facilitates internet access for instances in the private subnet.

11. **Main Route Table Identification**: The script identifies the ID of the main route table associated with the VPC.

12. **Main Route Table Tagging**: Tags are added to the main route table to enhance its identification and management.

13. **NAT Gateway Addition to Main Route Table**: A route is added to the main route table, directing internet-bound traffic to the NAT 
  gateway.

The script provides a comprehensive automation solution for setting up a basic network architecture in AWS, encompassing VPC creation, internet access configuration, subnet segmentation, and route table management. It is intended to simplify the process of network setup and ensure adherence to best practices in infrastructure as code.

Please note that while the script provides a functional foundation for network automation, it can be further enhanced with error handling, parameterization, and additional configurations based on specific use cases and requirements.
